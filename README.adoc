= CNC - Database Replication Tool

== Introduction
CNC is a robust tool designed in C to facilitate the replication of databases from a host to a target system. With its current focus on PostgreSQL, CNC aims to simplify and automate the database replication process, especially in cloud environments, thereby catering to the needs of DevOps teams.

== Features
- *Database Replication*: Seamlessly replicate databases from a host to a target system with minimal manual intervention.
- *PostgreSQL Support*: Currently supports PostgreSQL with plans to extend functionality to other database systems.
- *Configuration Management*: Easy management of database and application settings through `.ini` files.
- *Email Notifications (Under development)*: Integrates email functionalities to notify about replication status or errors.
