= Database Operator API

The Database Operator API provides a consistent interface for interacting with different types of databases. It is defined in `db.h` and implemented in `db.c`.


== `available_dbs` Global Variable

The `available_dbs` global variable is an array of pointers to `db_operations` structures. It is defined in `db.h` and declared differently for each database implementation . Each element in the array represents a different database implementation.

== db_operations Structure

The `db_operations` structure contains the following members:

* `connect`: This function is used to establish a connection to the database. It takes the following parameters:

** `host`: The hostname of the database server.
** `db_name`: The name of the database.
** `user`: The username to use for authentication.
** `password`: The password to use for authentication.

It returns 0 on success and a non-zero value on failure.

[source,c]
----
int (*connect)(const char *host, const char *db_name, const char *user, const char *password);
----

* `close`: This function is used to close the connection to the database. It does not take any parameters.

[source,c]
----
void (*close)(void);
----

* `replicate`: This function is used to execute the necessary SQL statements for the replication on the database. It takes the following parameter:

** `sql`: The SQL statement to execute.

It returns 0 on success and a non-zero value on failure.

[source,c]
----
int (*replicate)(const char *sql);
----

* `db`: This is a pointer to a `db_t` structure. The `db_t` structure represents a database connection and is defined by the specific database implementation.

[source,c]
----
struct db_t *db;
----

Each database implementation should define a `db_operations` structure with its own set of functions.

== Database Implementations

Each database that adds support to the Database Operator API will need to create its own `db_operations` structure and define the function pointers for `connect`, `close`, `replicate`, and struct pointer for `db`. Also, an `init` function is needed, similar to `construct_pg` in `postgres.c` to make the necessary memory allocations, and populate the necessary fields from config. This allows each database to provide its own implementation of these operations.

For example, a PostgreSQL database might define its `db_operations` structure as follows:

[source,c]
----
struct db_operations postgres_ops = {
    .connect = postgres_connect,
    .close = postgres_close,
    .replicate = postgres_replicate,
    .db = &postgres_db,
};
----

In this example, `postgres_connect`, `postgres_close`, `postgres_replicate` are functions defined by the PostgreSQL database to implement the corresponding operations, and `postgres_db` is a `db_t` structure representing a PostgreSQL database connection.

Remember to update the `available_dbs` array in `db.c` to include the new `db_operations` structure when a new database adds support by using the ADD_FUNC macro, with the `init` function, that will act as an entry point to the rest of operations.
